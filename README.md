# PlantNet API
A RESTful API that diagnoses plants using images of their leaves. Powered by Deep Learning.

## How To Run Locally

## Background

*PlantNet*: the convolutional neural network for this API was developed using transfer learning. The full implementation is available [in this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper/DS-2.4-Advanced-Topics/blob/main/Notebooks/Computer_Vision/Plant_Vision.ipynb).

If you wish to access the weights and biases of the CNN used in production, you can download them [here](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper/DS-2.4-Advanced-Topics/tree/main/Notebooks/Computer_Vision/checkpoint) (same repo as above). Look for the files that start with `inception`.
